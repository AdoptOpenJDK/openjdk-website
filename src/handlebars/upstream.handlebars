      <h4 class="bold">What are these binaries?</h4>
      <p>Upstream binaries were built by Red Hat on their infrastructure and distributed by AdoptOpenJDK on behalf of the OpenJDK jdk8u and jdk11u community projects.
      The last releases produced by this method were 8u342 and 11.0.16 (July 2022 CPU update).
      This service is now provided by the <a href="https://adoptium.net/">Adoptium</a> project, and users of upstream builds should now migrate to the equivalent
      <a href="https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/">Eclipse Temurin</a> releases.</p>
